---


The Multitenancy feature empowers users to efficiently manage multiple tenants within a single account.
Whether it's overseeing diverse projects, departments, or clients, this functionality streamlines organizational
management and enhances collaboration across various entities.

### Overview
The Multitenancy feature enables users to create and manage multiple tenants within their account. Each tenant operates
autonomously, possessing its own settings, members, and resources, facilitating seamless organization and management.

### Default Tenant
Upon account creation, users are provided with a default tenant. This serves as the primary unit for their activities,
enabling immediate engagement without additional setup.

### Tenant Creation
Users can create additional tenants as needed, allowing them to manage multiple projects or entities within the same
account. Each tenant can be customized to meet specific requirements, ensuring flexibility and scalability.

### Membership Roles
The Multitenancy feature introduces three distinct roles for members within each tenant:

- Owner: Owners wield full control and authority over the tenant. They can manage settings, invite new members, assign roles, and oversee tenant activities.
- Admin: Admins assist owners in managing the tenant. They possess similar privileges to owners but may have limitations on certain administrative actions.
- Member: Members are regular users within the tenant, contributing to projects and collaborating with teammates.
### Invitation System
Owners can invite new members to join their tenant, controlling access and ensuring secure collaboration. Invited
members receive notifications and can accept or decline invitations, facilitating seamless onboarding.

### Tenant Management
Owners have comprehensive control over tenant settings, member management, and resource allocation. This centralized
management enhances efficiency and coordination within the tenant.

### Benefits
- Efficient Organization: Users can manage multiple projects or entities within a single account, reducing complexity and streamlining workflow.
- Customization: Each tenant can be tailored to suit specific requirements, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
- Collaboration: The invitation system and role-based access control facilitate seamless collaboration among members, enhancing productivity and teamwork.
- Centralized Management: Owners have centralized control over tenant-wide settings and activities, ensuring consistency and governance.

### Conclusion
The Multitenancy feature enables users to effectively manage multiple tenants within our platform. With customizable
settings, role-based access control, and centralized management, users can optimize organizational efficiency and
collaboration across diverse projects and teams.
